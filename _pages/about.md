<p>
I was 15 and my dad drove me and four friends of mine to Club 178 in Sanremo, to listen to Marcell Dettmann's dj set. I remember his dj-set started with a very elegant and slow fade in of a classic techno tune, that was playing louder and louder through best sound system I had ever heard at that time. It was my first techno club experience, and that night my dna changed. I had to be around music, I had to make it, listen to it, dance it, and even work with it at some point. My journey started and so far I have been cultivating my professional career in electronics engineering and music production.
</p>  
I am currently working as a senior electronics engineer at [teenage engineering](https://teenage.engineering/).  
I produce music as [[music|vesto comodo]].  

I am often excited to collaborate, make new products, release new music, talk tech, talk synthesizers so:
